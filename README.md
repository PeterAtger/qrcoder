# qrcoder

A QR code scanner / attendance Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Just download and take an image of QR image
Image must be of JSON file, and you can change the JSON data in PersonFromBar
Class which makes a Person object from QR code data

## This can be used as a base for a bigger project but for now it solved my simple problem of taking attendance
